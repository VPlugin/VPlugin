                VPlugin is a Rust framework to develop and use plugins on applications and libraries, <br> including but not limited to games, text editors, command line and graphical applications.

## But why?
I found myself ever since starting out programming struggling to find a proper solution to creating a plugin API without copying other's code. Eventually, I decided to write my own library, which ended up becoming a fully-featured set of tools that would allow me to easily write a plugin system from scratch without having to do the same thing 1000 times.

Generally, VPlugin aims to become a low-level block in your application, where you are going to build everything else on top of. VPlugin will **not** create the plugin system for you; It will do the dirty under-the-hood work and give you a high-level abstraction over it.

## Features
- üöÄ Blazingly Fast (Thanks to Rust!)
- üá©üî• Easy to use, without compromises on flexibility.
- üíª Cross-platform and portable, will work on most major platforms.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Modern: Forget nasty workarounds and strange errors in your code.

## MSRV
VPlugin officially supports only the latest **stable** version of the Rust language. You may be able to get it to compile on a few older versions, but do not be confused if your computer blows up or you get a ton of error messages on the console.

## Repo Contents
This repository contains the library that implements VPlugin, as well as the Plugin Format Specification and some other related stuff. For other related projects, see the [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/VPlugin).

## Examples
An example application is available [here](https://github.com/VPlugin/vplugin-example). For more information about it, see the README file.

## Supported Languages
Generally, most compiled languages will be supported, as long as they can build as a shared object file (shared library). This means that while VPlugin itself is Rust-only for now, it's perfectly possible to write a plugin usable by VPlugin in C, C++ or even Vala. See [the Plugin Specification](./spec/PluginFormat.md) for more details. Key requirement here is a way to export your types to those languages, which requires giving off safety guarantees and a lot of expertise.
